### **Introduction to HTML**

HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the fundamental language used to create and structure web pages. Unlike programming languages, it is a **markup language**, 
meaning it annotates text to define how content should be displayed in browsers. HTML provides the framework for web content such as text, images, links, audio, and video. 
It is the backbone of nearly all websites, with over 95% of web pages using it in some form. By learning HTML, developers gain the ability to design webpages with a clear 
structure, forming the basis for styling with CSS and adding interactivity with JavaScript.


### **Basic HTML Document Structure**

Every HTML page follows a standardized structure, starting with a **document type declaration (`<!DOCTYPE html>`)** that specifies the version of HTML being used. The document is enclosed within `<html>` tags, which act as the root element. Inside `<html>`, there are two main sections:
1. **`<head>`** – This section contains metadata, such as the document’s title, character encoding (`<meta charset>`), viewport settings for responsive design, and links to stylesheets or scripts. The content in the head section is **not displayed directly** on the webpage.
2. **`<body>`** – This section contains the visible content of the webpage, such as paragraphs, headings, images, and links. Everything inside `<body>` is rendered in the browser window.
Example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>My Webpage</title>
</head>
<body>
    <p>Welcome to my webpage!</p>
</body>
</html>
```

This example creates a basic webpage with a responsive design and displays a paragraph of text.

### **Headings**

HTML uses six levels of headings, `<h1>` through `<h6>`, to indicate the hierarchy of content. `<h1>` represents the most important or largest heading, while `<h6>` is the 
smallest. Headings improve the readability and structure of a page and are also important for search engine optimization (SEO).

Example:

```html
<h1>Main Heading</h1>
<h2>Subheading</h2>
<h3>Section Title</h3>
```

### **Paragraphs and Line Breaks**

Paragraphs in HTML are defined with the `<p>` tag, which automatically separates blocks of text. Single line breaks within a paragraph can be added using the `<br>` tag. 
This ensures that text appears neatly and is easier to read.

Example:

```html
<p>
    HTML is a markup language.<br>
    It is used to create structured web pages.<br>
    Hypertext links pages together.
</p>
```

### **Horizontal Lines**

The `<hr>` tag is used to insert a horizontal line, which visually separates content sections. It is an **empty tag**, meaning it does not require a closing tag.

Example:

```html
<p>Section One</p>
<hr>
<p>Section Two</p>
```

### **Comments**

Comments in HTML are annotations that are **not displayed** on the page but help document the code for developers. They are enclosed within `<!--` and `-->`. Comments 
are useful for explaining code, marking sections, or temporarily disabling elements during testing.

Example:

```html
<!-- This is a heading -->
<h1>Welcome</h1>
<!-- This paragraph explains the website purpose -->
<p>Learn HTML basics here.</p>
```

**Best Practices:** Keep comments concise, relevant, and up-to-date. Avoid stating obvious things.

### **Images**

Images are added to web pages using the `<img>` tag. The **source of the image** is defined with the `src` attribute, and additional attributes like `alt`, `width`, and 
`height` can enhance accessibility and control layout.



### **Viewing HTML Source Code**

Understanding how to inspect HTML code is an important skill.

1. **View entire page source:** Press `Ctrl+U` (or right-click → “View Page Source”) to see all the HTML behind a page.
2. **Inspect specific elements:** Right-click on a specific element and choose “Inspect” to see the HTML and CSS for that element. This is useful for debugging or learning 
how a page is structured.

Learning HTML is the first step toward web development. Mastering basic tags like headings, paragraphs, images, comments, and document structure allows developers to 
create organized, readable, and functional web pages. With practice, these foundational skills enable you to build more complex, interactive, and visually appealing websites 
using CSS and JavaScript in combination with HTML.
